Phase Display
=============

This project displays RSS feeds, stock quotes, weather etc on a RGB LED display.
It consists of two parts, a server (running on Heroku) that gathers the information
and a client application running on the Raspberry Pi that acts as a display.
 
The root directory is the server node application. Deploy it to Heroku by typing

	$ git push heroku master
